Build a static site for your style guide.

## Usage

*Components* make up your styleguide, and it's suggested that you separate these into useful parts. 

*Layouts* are provided with variables for laying out your components after they have been processed. You can loop through them to build navigation, previews or whatever you like.

Build your site with

```bash
$ gulp
```
